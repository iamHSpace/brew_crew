# brew_crew

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This project helped me learn authentication using firebase in any flutter app.

## Working

- Clone it in your directory and run: 
> flutter run 
  
- It will download packages and application would run smoothly in emulator.

- use  following command to build apk for an app:
> flutter build apk 

- The app can be used to maintain record of preferences of a group for their coffee. 

- Suggestions and feedback are always welcomed. Thank you. 

## Have Fun.
